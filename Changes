0.29    2013-02-25T20:25:44+0100
    - fixed regex to filter use/require (RT83569) (reported by
      ribasushi)


0.28   2012-08-21T14:41:15+0200
    - whitespace in use base is valid (Barbie)


0.27	2012-03-23T12:40:44+0100
    - fixed 23_universal_require.t for real (RT75342) (reported by
      Manoj Kumar and Paul Howarth)


0.26    2012-03-23T08:42:25+0100
    - removed Test::NoWarning from a t/23_universal_require.t because
      it upsets the (manual) plan if the tests are skipped


0.25    2012-03-22T10:55:42+0100
    - autogenerate the grammer during ./Build (based on a patch by
      jtbraun@CPAN.org) (RT74879)
    - added $VERSION to into Module::ExtractUse::Grammar, suggested
      by Manoj Kumar (RT75342)
    - specify min verion of Parse::RecDescent (1.967009),
      suggested by ANDK@cpan.org (RT75130)
    - fix typos reported by gregor herrmann (RT75115)
    - switched to Dist::Zilla (all on my own!)


0.24    2012-02-12T14:27:36+0100
    - regenerated Grammer to work with new Parse::RecDescent
      (thanks to cpan-testers, TMUELLER, KENTNL, dirkus@yo****.com and
      paul@city****.org for reporting the problem)


0.23   2008-04-26 22:14:28
    - fixed bug regarding 'use utf8' which was interpreted as 'utf'


0.22    2007-11-16
    - added 'use warnings' again to the Grammer... grr, stupid grammer
      generator


0.21    2007-11-14
    - fixed Bug reported by hanekomu via IRC:
      Modules::ExtractUse breaks if it is used with UNIVERSAL::require
      so I renamed the grammer tokens 'use' and 'require'. No API changes, 
      but if you use the grammer directly, you'll have to adapt to the new 
      names ('token_use' and 'token_reqire')


0.20    2007-11-07
    - resolved RT #30414 by applying the patch submitted by
      David Landgren

    - added 'use warnings' to Module::ExtractUse::Grammer for that
      extra kwalitee point

      we can now handle stuff like:
          my $ver=1.22;
